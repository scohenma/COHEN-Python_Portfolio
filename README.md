# COHEN-Python_Portfolio

 
This portfolio is designed to show my professional experiences and the projects I will be working on during my Elements of Computing II class, which I am taking as part of my **Computing and Digital Technologies** Minor. It will serve to highlight my progress on my professional journey, featuring updates that demonstrate my programming expertise and technical skills.

## Repository Structure
* **Weekly Assignments**: This subfolder includes assignments that I complete during class time two times a week. It is updated every week with new material, covering everything the class entails throughout the semester. 
* **basic-streamlit-app**: This folder includes projects and assignments I have done using **Streamlit
  * The **main.py** script inside this folder allows users to interact with various filters to analyze a specific penguin dataset. This is an ongoing project where I continue to improve the app by refining the user experience and expanding its analytical capabilities.
  * The **README.md** inside this folder provides a description and guidance into the Streamlit app.
* **[Tidy-Data Project](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData%20-%20Project%20)**: This folder includes a new project I have worked on during my class. It applies tidy data principles to analyze a specific dataset regarding the **2008 Olympics**. This project complements my coding portafolio as it showcases how to combine different skills from understanding the data to developing visuals that allow the user to immmerse in the data and learn about it easily. 
   * The **README.md** file inside this folder provides a more extensive description and guidance into how to run and understand the project. However, some       basic findings from this analysis were:
         *   Some sports award more medals due to multiple event categories or team participation.
         *   There were notable gender disparities in 2008, with some sports excluding women entirely or offering less opportunities for them. 
         *   The evolution of female participation in sports raises  questions for future research about the progress of this challenge.
