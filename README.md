# COHEN-Python_Portfolio

 
This portfolio is designed to show my professional experiences and the projects I will be working on during my Elements of Computing II class, which I am taking as part of my **Computing and Digital Technologies** Minor. It will serve to highlight my progress on my professional journey, featuring updates that demonstrate my programming expertise and technical skills.

## Repository Structure

* [**University Explorer – StreamlitAppFinal**](https://cohen-pythonportfolio-mwojbbcv7agaf6b7yumbhh.streamlit.app/):
  
  * This is a fully developed Streamlit web application designed to help high school students discover and compare mission-driven             universities in the U.S. I created a custom dataset by researching 10 institutions that reflect the same values I’ve experienced at        Notre Dame — including purpose, community, and academic excellence.
  * The app offers two interactive options: one helps students filter and find schools based on tuition, diversity, and class size            preferences, and the other provides  profiles of each university with images, fun facts, academic highlights, and  advice depending        on the user's high school grade.
  * Inside the repository, the README.md includes instructions, app features, and  screenshots to demonstrate how the app works in             practice.
      
 This project complements my portfolio by showcasing my ability to build an interactive front-end using Python and Streamlit, while also managing data cleaning, user experience design, and visualizations. It also reflects my personal interests in higher education access and decision-making tools, specifically for people that might have a harder time deciding due to personal factors. 
 
* [**Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project**](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitAPP):
  
 * This is a new project I have worked on during the second half of my class. It is an interactive Named Entity Recognition (NER) app        built using Python, spaCy, and Streamlit. It allows users to input their own text or use sample texts, define custom entities, and see     real-time entity detection results highlighted directly in their input.I built this as part of my  class to explore natural language       processing and gain hands-on experience with Streamlit apps. It complements my portafolio by demonstrating my ability to combine user      interaction, rule-based logic, visualization and different applications into one single Python project. I will continue working and    
  expanding on it as my class continue, in order to create a succesful addition to my portafolio. 
   * The **app.py** file contains the full code for the Streamlit, including the text input, entity rule creation, and spaCy's NLP             pipeline. It also includes the sample texts that are available for users. 
   * Inside the  folder, there is also a **README.md** with more detailed setup instructions.
   * The project also includes a **`requirements.txt`** file for installing all necessary dependencies for local use or deployment.

* [**Tidy-Data Project**](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData%20-%20Project%20):
  
  * This folder includes a new project I have worked on during my class. It applies tidy data principles to analyze a specific dataser
    regarding the **2008 Olympics**. This project complements my coding portafolio as it showcases how to combine different skills from
    understanding the data to developing visuals that allow the user to immmerse in the data and learn about it easily. 
   * The **README.md** file inside this folder provides a more extensive description and guidance into how to run and understand the
   project. However, some basic findings from this analysis were:
         *   Some sports award more medals due to multiple event categories or team participation.
         *   There were notable gender disparities in 2008, with some sports excluding women entirely or offering less opportunities for                them. 
         *   The evolution of female participation in sports raises  questions for future research about the progress of this challenge. 

* [**Weekly Assignments**](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio/tree/main/Weekly_Assignments):
   * This subfolder includes assignments that I complete during class time two times a week. It is updated every week with new material,   
    covering everything the class entails throughout the semester.
  
* [**basic-streamlit-app**](https://github.com/scohenma/COHEN-Python_Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app):
  * This folder includes projects and assignments I have done using **Streamlit
  * The **main.py** script inside this folder allows users to interact with various filters to analyze a specific penguin dataset. This is     an ongoing project where I continue to improve the app by refining the user experience and expanding its analytical capabilities.
  * The **README.md** inside this folder provides a description and guidance into the Streamlit app.
