# COHEN-Python_Portfolio

 
This portfolio is designed to show my professional experiences and the projects I will be working on during my Elements of Computing II class, which I am taking as part of my **Computing and Digital Technologies** Minor. It will serve to highlight my progress on my professional journey, featuring updates that demonstrate my programming expertise and technical skills.

## Repository Structure
* **Weekly Assignments**: This subfolder includes assignments that I complete during class time two times a week.
* **basic-streamlit-app**: This folder includes projects and assignments I have done using **Streamlit
