# COHEN-Python_Portfolio

 
This portfolio is designed to show my professional experiences and the projects I will be working on during my Elements of Computing II class, which I am taking as part of my **Computing and Digital Technologies** Minor. It will serve to highlight my progress on my professional journey, featuring updates that demonstrate my programming expertise and technical skills.


## Basic Streamlit App: Palmer's Penguins Explorer
Inside the `basic_streamlit_app/main.py`, I have developed a Streamlit app that allows users to interact with various filters to analyze a penguin dataset. The dataset includes details such as species, island habitat,  measurements, and other characteristics.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- **Load and process CSV data** in Python.
- **Develop interactive components** using Streamlit.
- **Apply real-time filtering** to visualize and analyze the dataset dynamically

This is an ongoing project where I continue to improve the app by refining the user experience and expanding its analytical capabilities.
